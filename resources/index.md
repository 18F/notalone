State sexual assault coalitions are valuable resources to find services in your area.  These coalitions provide lists of all the local rape crisis centers and often run statewide hotlines.  Local crisis centers and service providers also frequently have hotlines.  Some of these programs may not be included in the Service Locator Map, and your [state coalition](http://www.justice.gov/ovw/local-resources) may be able to provide you with additional information.  

## Organizations and Services

Many other websites provide information about campus sexual assault – what it is, how to get help, how to prevent assault, and ways to take action. We do not endorse any particular website, but want you to have access to lots of different resources.

### LGBTQ Resources
Many survivors identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT). Unfortunately, the LGBT community experiences sexual violence at high rates. One study found that 13.2% of bisexual men and 11.6% of gay men were raped in adulthood, compared to 1.6% of heterosexual men. [i](#i){: .cite} According to the CDC, 46% of bisexual women have been raped, compared to 13% of lesbians and 17% of heterosexual women. [ii](#ii){: .cite} Another study found that more than 25% of transgender individuals had been sexually assaulted after the age of 13. [iii](#iii){: .cite} All survivors, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation, should be able to access resources. The below resources provide supportive, user-friendly services and information for survivors and allies.

People with physical or mental disabilities may also be at increased risk for sexual assault. A study reported that individuals with a disability were three times more likely to be raped or sexually assaulted than individuals without a disability. [iv](#iv){: .cite} Unfortunately, many people with disabilities experience barriers when attempting to access services and resources.

### Male Survivor Resources
Approximately 1 in 10 sexual assault survivors is male, but these cases go unreported even more often than usual. Male survivors may stay silent out of fear, shame, or self-blame, but sexual assault affects every survivor regardless of gender identity. The below resources provide resources designed to address the needs of male survivors.

### Immigrant and International Resources
While numbers are difficult to estimate, immigrants and international students face unique difficulties. Perpetrators may threaten to have their victims deported if they try to seek help, making immigrant survivors less likely to report these crimes. Immigrant and international student survivors may also be unaware or confused by the services that are available, particularly if service providers lack linguistically or culturally appropriate resources. The below resources provide resources for international and immigrant survivors.
