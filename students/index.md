## What do I do if I have been sexually assaulted?

### Immediately after an assault

#### Ask for help, make a call:
* 911
*	Campus police
*	Friends or family
* Crisis hotline 800-656-HOPE (4673)

#### Go to urgent care (e.g., a hospital):
*	Receive help for physical injuries.
* Screen for STDs/pregnancy.
* If possible, do not shower or cleaning up. Do not change clothes. Hospital staff can collect evidence using a rape kit.
* If you want to file a police report, you can call the police from the emergency room.
* Ask about the [nearest rape crisis center]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/#find-a-service-near-you).

### Days following an assault
Take care of your physical and emotional well-being. Try to eat well, get enough sleep, and exercise. Remember that it was not your fault and you are not alone.

#### Learn about common reactions to trauma.
Everyone is different, but it is good to understand [what you might expect](http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/problems/common-reactions-after-trauma.asp) and know that others have experienced similar reactions.

#### Let others help.
*	**Friends and family** can offer support by listening to you, keeping you company, walking to class with you, or going with you to appointments.
*	**Campus health centers** can provide health services and help you find additional health resources including counseling.
    * If you are concerned about confidentiality ask the person you want to talk to first about his/her obligation to disclose information you share (e.g., filing a report). Click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/students#will-what-i-share-remain-confidential) for more information.
* **Local rape crisis center staff** are experienced with how to help you. They can help you make choices about reporting an assault, joining a support group or finding a counselor.
* Click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/know-your-rights.pdf) to learn more about what accommodations should be offered to you.

### Months after an assault

* Recovery is an **ongoing gradual process**. Understand [common reactions after trauma](http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/problems/common-reactions-after-trauma.asp). Some symptoms may appear months after an assault.
* **Reach out** to your personal support network of friends and family. Find a support group.
* **Talk to a counselor or psychologist.** They are experienced in helping individuals who have been sexually assaulted. They are familiar with the physiological and psychological effects that traumatic events cause. They can help you work through your emotions and teach you coping skills. Learn more [here](http://www.womenshealth.gov/mental-health/help/index.html).
* If your school does not offer mental health services, find a provider [here](http://samhsa.gov/tools/).


## Know Your Rights
<div class="section-context">
<div class="section-context-text">
### Your Title IX Rights
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex against any person in education programs and activities receiving federal funding. Programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance include virtually all public and private colleges and universities, and all public elementary and secondary schools.

Students, staff, faculty, and other employees; women, girls, men, and boys; straight, LGBT, and gender-nonconforming persons; persons with and without disabilities; and international and undocumented persons all have the right to pursue education, including athletic programs, scholarships, and other activities, free from sex discrimination, including sexual violence and harassment.

Sex-based discrimination in public schools also implicates legal rights under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act, which is enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice.

</div>
</div>

<div class="section-context-text">
#### What are a school’s responsibilities under Title IX to address sexual violence?
- A school has a responsibility to respond promptly and effectively to reports of sexual violence.

- If a school knows (or reasonably should know) about possible sexual violence, it must quickly investigate to determine what occurred and then take appropriate steps to resolve the situation.
- A criminal investigation into allegations of sexual violence does not relieve a school of its duty under Title IX to resolve reports promptly and effectively.

- A school must ensure that the person who experienced the sexual violence is safe, even while an investigation is ongoing.

## How Do I File a Complaint About My School? And Then What Happens?
<div class="section-context">
### Can I File a Complaint?

<div class="section-context-text">
If you believe you are a victim of sex-based discrimination in an educational program receiving funding from the federal government, you can file a Title IX complaint with both the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). Programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance include virtually all public and private colleges and universities, and all public elementary and secondary schools.

If you file a complaint of sex-based discrimination with the DOJ, it can also be reviewed under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title IV), which provides similar protections to Title IX at all public schools.


</div>

<div class="section-context-text">
#### Is filing a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice the same as filing a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights?

No, though the process is quite similar. The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has the authority to investigate all allegations of Title IX violations at educational institutions that receive federal funding. DOJ can investigate allegations of sex-based discrimination at educational institutions that receive DOJ funds (e.g., [a grant from the Office on Violence Against Women](http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/grant2013.htm)) under Title IX and at all public schools under Title IV. If you file with both DOJ and OCR, **usually, one agency will conduct the investigation of the school**. Occasionally, both agencies will conduct a joint investigation.

Both OCR and DOJ can and do conduct proactive compliance reviews under Title IX of schools the Departments fund, even in the absence of a complaint.

## Will What I Share Remain Confidential?

<div class="section-context">
###Understanding Confidentiality
<div class="section-context-text">

Sexual assault survivors respond in different ways. Some are able to be public about what has happened to them. Some are ready to press forward with a formal complaint. Others aren’t so sure. And they need someone they can talk to confidentially -- to try to regain a sense of control, to start healing, and to sort through their options at their own pace.

If you feel this way, know that not all of a school’s employees can maintain your confidentiality. Your school should make clear who you can turn to – like professional or pastoral counselors, or maybe a women’s center or health center – to talk confidentially. Your school should also make clear who **can’t** maintain confidentiality; if you talk to these people – they’re sometimes called “responsible employees” – you have the right to expect your school to investigate what happened and to take prompt action to address the situation. If you’re not sure if someone can maintain your confidentiality – ask before you talk to them.

To help make you more aware of your options, we are providing a sample policy on reporting and confidentiality for schools to consider. As with all policies, we urge schools to involve students in coming up with the best solutions.  But all policies should make clear, up front, who on campus must share what information with whom – and how a school should weigh a survivor’s request for confidentiality against its own obligation to provide a safe environment for all students.

In general, rape crisis center advocates can speak with you confidentially. But because state law is always changing, be sure to check the accuracy of this information.

#### State Confidentiality Laws
While this list is a helpful tool, it is not a replacement for asking the person whether or not they are a confidential resource. Since state law is constantly changing on this issue, **be sure to verify the information** provided in this guide.
