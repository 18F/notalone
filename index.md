<div class="top-message">
Information for students, schools, and anyone interested in finding resources on how to respond to and prevent sexual assault. Click below to find a crisis service, learn more about students' rights, schools' obligations to protect students from sexual assault, how to file a complaint with the Federal Government, and view a map of resolved school-level enforcement activities.

Throughout this website the term, “school” refers to all public educational
institutions and all schools that receive federal funds, including
elementary and secondary schools (including charter schools), school
districts, colleges, and universities. Sections of the website that are
only applicable at the postsecondary or elementary and secondary school
level add clarifying information.

NotAlone was launched in connection with the White House Task Force to
Protect Students from Sexual Assault. The Task Force was established on
January 22, 2014 – and since then, thousands of people have shared their
stories and ideas about how best to eliminate sexual assault in schools.
