## School-by-School Enforcement Map

This map includes information about resolved school-level enforcement activities conducted by the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice. These activities include Title IX resolution agreements addressing sexual violence on campuses from the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, Clery Act reports from the Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid office, and Title IX and Title IV resolution agreements and other court filings addressing sexual violence and sexual harassment on campuses from the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division. For an explanation of the Clery Act and Titles IX and IV, please see the Key Terms and Definitions section of the [the Students page.](/students/#key-terms-and-definitions)

The U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), is posting recent resolution letters and agreements with schools on its [website](http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/search-ocr.html).  OCR will also make public the schools that are under OCR investigation, including those that involve Title IX sexual violence allegations.  To ensure that the most up-to-date information is provided, interested parties should contact [OCR headquarters](malito:ocr@ed.gov) or the [closest regional office](https://wdcrobcolp01.ed.gov/CFAPPS/OCR/contactus.cfm).

## Clery Act Data

The Department of Education maintains individual school level data about campus crime and makes this data publicly available at: [http://ope.ed.gov/security](http://ope.ed.gov/security).  This data is submitted by each higher education institution pursuant to the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act), and is updated on a yearly basis.  For the first time, in 2015, institutions must now report the name and contact information of the school’s lead Title IX Coordinator.
