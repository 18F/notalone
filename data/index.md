The U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), is posting recent resolution letters and agreements with schools on its [website](http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/search-ocr.html).  OCR will also make public the schools that are under OCR investigation, including those that involve Title IX sexual violence allegations.  To ensure that the most up-to-date information is provided, interested parties should contact [OCR headquarters](malito:ocr@ed.gov) or the [closest regional office](https://wdcrobcolp01.ed.gov/CFAPPS/OCR/contactus.cfm).

## Clery Act Data

The Department of Education maintains individual school level data about campus crime and makes this data publicly available at: [http://ope.ed.gov/security](http://ope.ed.gov/security).  This data is submitted by each higher education institution pursuant to the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act), and is updated on a yearly basis.  For the first time, in 2015, institutions must now report the name and contact information of the school’s lead Title IX Coordinator.
