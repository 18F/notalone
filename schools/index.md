## Legal Guidance
<div class="section-context">
### Title IX Compliance Requirements
<div class="section-context-text">
#### Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence (2014)

- In April 2014, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued a questions and answers document to provide additional guidance to federally funded education institutions about their obligations under Title IX to address sexual violence.
- This guidance further clarifies the legal requirements under Title IX articulated in OCR’s 2011 Dear Colleague Letter on Sexual Violence and its 2001 Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance.

#### Retaliation Guidance (2013)

- In April 2013, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued guidance to remind federally funded education institutions that retaliation is a violation of federal law.
- Under federal civil rights laws, including Title IX, it is illegal for a school to retaliate against an individual for speaking out against possible civil rights problems at the school.
- The prohibition against retaliation means that if a student, parent, teacher, professor, coach, or other individual complains formally or informally to a school about a potential civil rights violation, such as failure to address sexual violence, or participates in an OCR or school investigation or proceeding, the school is prohibited from retaliating against the individual because of their complaint or participation.

## Understanding FERPA, the Clery Act, and Title IX

Colleges and universities that participate in the federal student financial aid programs are subject to Title IX and the Clery Act, and must comply their requirements that certain employees report incidents of sexual violence to school officials and notify students about the outcome when they file complaints of sexual violence.

We created a chart to help schools understand these requirements, clarify how they intersect with students' rights under FERPA, and resolve any concerns about apparent conflicts.

## Maintaining Confidentiality

### Principles of Confidentiality

Schools often struggle with balancing a survivor’s confidentiality and fulfilling their obligation to provide a safe campus for everyone by holding perpetrators accountable.  But a few guiding principles should inform any reporting and confidentiality protocol: namely that confidentiality must give survivors choices and not shield a school from inaction.  To the greatest extent possible, the survivor’s wishes should be respected, whether it be for a full investigation – or not.

It’s also true that there’s no one-size-fits-all model of survivor care.  There must be options, which means that schools should make it clear up front who on campus must share what information with whom – and the circumstances in which a school may need to override a request for confidentiality and conduct an investigation to protect the greater campus community.

And in all cases, whether or not it fully investigates a particular incident, schools must respond. It must protect and help survivors reclaim their education, and determine what campus-wide, or more targeted, responses may be in order.

To help schools carry out these principles, we’ve come up with a sample reporting and confidentiality policy.  This is not meant as a policy to “cut and paste,” but rather one to help schools get started tackling this difficult issue.

## Developing Sexual Assault Policies and Procedures

### Guide to Drafting a Sexual Assault Policy

Every college and university should have an easily accessible, user-friendly sexual assault policy. As the Task Force recognizes, there is no one approach that suits every school – but as we also heard, schools have had difficulty constructing comprehensive policies.  To help schools develop or reevaluate their policies:

We are providing schools with a checklist for a sexual misconduct policy. This list provides both a suggested process for developing a policy, as well as the key elements a school should consider in drafting one.  At the threshold, and perhaps most importantly, schools should bring all the key stakeholders to the table – including students, survivors, concerned student groups including LGBT organizations, campus security, local law enforcement, resident advisors, on-campus advocates, and local victim service providers.  Effective policies will vary in scope and detail, but an inclusive process is common to all.

We have not endeavored with this checklist to provide schools with all the answers: again, depending on its size, mission, student body, location, administrative structure and experience, a school community is best situated to decide for itself what might work best.

</div>

### Role of Title IX Coordinator

A school’s Title IX coordinator(s) is expected to play a critical role in helping a school ensure that every person affected by its operations—including faculty, staff, and students—are aware of their legal rights under Title IX, and that the school and all of its officials, through its policies, procedures, and practices, complies with its legal obligations under Title IX. This sample language can serve as a guide that highlights issues for schools to consider when assigning the Title IX coordinator functions and responsibilities related to their response to incidents of sexual misconduct.

</div>

### Interim and supportive measures for victims

Interim measures are the services, accommodations, or other assistance that colleges must provide to victims after notice of alleged sexual misconduct but before any final school outcomes – investigatory, disciplinary, or remedial – have been determined. This document provides assistance on how “interim measures” required by Title IX can be incorporated into a college’s sexual misconduct policy and offers sample policy language.  In addition, schools can offer supportive measures to victims who do not report the sexual violence, but are seeking assistance from through counselors and victim advocates. This sample language can help schools develop policies in both these areas.

</div>

### Definitions of key terms in sexual misconduct policies

Under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, any educational institution receiving Federal financial assistance must notify the school community of its nondiscrimination policy, and must adopt and publish grievance procedures providing for the prompt and equitable resolution of sex discrimination complaints.  This sample language will help schools ensure that students have a clear understanding of what constitutes sexual misconduct, when such conduct creates a hostile environment, the potential consequences for such conduct, and how the school processes complaints.

        ### Elements of Providing Victim Services Information

        #### Key Components of Sexual Assault Crisis Intervention/Victim Service Resources

        Most colleges and universities seek to provide services and advocacy for victims of sexual assault. These services may be provided on campus or off campus via a memorandum of understanding with a local rape crisis center or victim advocacy program. This document discusses the existing research on sexual assault crisis intervention and victim services. It is meant to be the start of a conversation for schools as they work to ensure accessible support services for victims on their campuses.

        ### Guidance for Developing Partnerships with Local Rape Crisis Centers
        Colleges and universities can strengthen sexual assault prevention and response programs by developing partnerships with local rape crisis centers. These partnerships can be formalized through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or other agreement between parties. MOUs are often mandated in grant applications, but schools should consider developing these partnerships regardless of whether they are applying for funding. This document provides guidance for developing these relationships along with a sample MOU.

### Conducting School Climate Surveys

#### Climate Surveys: Useful Tools to Help College or Universities in Their Efforts to Reduce and Prevent Sexual Assault
Many schools are working to address sexual assault on their campuses, but lack a way to understand the scope or nature of the problem. Climate surveys can help fill this gap in knowledge by finding out how students perceive and experience sexual assault on their campus. Conducting regular climate surveys is a best practice in dealing with campus sexual assault. Universities and colleges often have both the capacity and the will to conduct meaningful climate surveys, but are not sure where to start. This document provides climate survey items/questions that are among the best currently available. The first chapter provides an overview of *how* to conduct a climate survey, and the second chapter provides an example of an empirically informed survey. Campuses are encouraged to use both of these chapters to guide their work.

## Prevention Resources

<div class="section-context">
### Empowering Bystanders to Act
<div class="section-context-text">

#### Bystander-Focused Prevention of Sexual Violence
Bystander intervention is a sexual assault prevention strategy that encourages witnesses to take safe action when they see a situation that might lead to sexual assault, and to support victims after an incident. Bystander intervention shows promise as a strategy to prevent sexual assault, particularly in college/university settings. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that bystander strategies may hold promise for the prevention of sexual assault, but more evaluation is needed. This document describes many different bystander programs used around the country and their common components. It also discusses how to deliver bystander education, and challenges to bystander action.

#### Preventing Sexual Violence on College Campuses: Lessons from Research and Practice

This document created by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes the best practices in developing, selecting, and implementing prevention strategies with the highest chance of successfully changing sexual violence in communities. While we have a lot to learn about how best to stop campus sexual violence before it starts, there are important steps that college campuses can take now to better address sexual violence.

#### Establishing Prevention Programming: Strategic Planning for Campuses
Preventing sexual assault in a college setting requires a thoughtful, well-planned approach. Campuses have many factors to consider when deciding what types of programming to offer and how to determine if their efforts are effective. Researchers are still studying the most effective forms of prevention. This document outlines key points to consider in strategic planning for campus sexual violence prevention. This process will look different for each campus, but this document provides preliminary guidelines and questions to get the process started.

#### Sexual Violence Prevention Strategies: An Overview
Prevention efforts should ultimately decrease the number of individuals who perpetrate sexual violence and the number of individuals who are sexual violence victims. Many prevention approaches aim to reduce risk factors and promote protective factors for sexual violence. In addition, comprehensive prevention strategies should address factors at each of the levels that influence sexual violence -the individual, relationship, community, and society.

#### American College Health Association Sexual Violence Toolkit
The American College Health Association developed the Shifting the Paradigm: Primary Prevention of Sexual Violence toolkit to provide facts, ideas, strategies, conversation starters, and resources to everyone on campus who cares about the prevention of sexual violence. While there is a rich volume of tools, knowledge, and resources for intervention after sexual violence, the emphasis of this toolkit is to encourage prevention activities that take place before sexual violence has occurred and which create social change and shift the norms regarding sexual violence.
